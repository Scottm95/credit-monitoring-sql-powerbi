Against the Coverage policy as since 24 hours have passed since last resolved, a new resolve check must be used in order to follow a CP drop down.

Noted on the account via a case from 26/02/2024 that C8 was given, PAC offered and the customer was informed that we'd waive off 60% of her ETF and she will pay remaining amount from the final bill.

60% of the ETF (£97.42) would have been a credit of £58.50 (Rounding up) - Advisor has given too little credit in this instance.

Unable to find evidence of the call from Vaibhav Thute on 26/02 where the customer was told that she had to only pay around £20 for her final bill.

Note: If the discount is added in the middle of a bill cycle, it'll appear prorated on their next bill.
•	If you’re offering a recurring discount and there’s a same value recurring discount already active on the account, you won’t be able to activate another one. In this scenario, don’t offer any higher value discounts to mitigate the issue. Instead deactivate the existing recurring discount and add the sum value of both the recurring discounts on the account.
Example: If you’re offering a £3 recurring discount due to CP5, however, there is a £3 recurring discount already active on the account, deactivate the existing £3 recurring discount and add (3+3)= £6 recurring discount on the account. Mention appropriate notes why did you deactivate the £3 recurring discount and reactivate the £6 recurring discount.
Tell them:
This is a one-time offer, valid until the current contract term ends, or until the issue is fixed; whichever is sooner and you'll see it on your next bill. If you choose to upgrade and the network hasn't improved, we won't be able to apply this discount again.
Note: Include the above information in the interaction notes and mention this is part of the trial.
If the customer wants compensation for the loss of their service, check their account to see if a network credit has been given recently for the same issue. If it has, check what dates this covers and only calculate from this date, up to 7 days line rental.
Note: You can only offer line rental credit from the date when the last credit finished.

Offer up to 7 days line rental using the Daily Line Rental Calculator.

Follow this process if a customer disputes a charge on their bill
For specific billing scenarios, and for when the customer says they've been overcharged because Three has made an error, including inadvertent roaming in Ireland, refer to the Billing Queries process.
You should never advise a customer to cancel their Direct Debit when there is a billing dispute.
If the customer was offered a credit in the same contract term, they’ll not be eligible for another one. OOB credits are limited to once per contract term, until the customer upgrades the contract and starts a new contract term.

If you've promised to apply a credit, and the customer is happy with it:

1
Apply a charge level credit by following this process using code B2C-Credit for Out Of Bundle.

2
Send the OOB_CRED SMS from Fusion

Below charges are excluded from the Out-of-Bundle (OOB) policy:

MMS charges for known handset issues
Charges incurred for Three Pay services.
Charges incurred for Shortcode services.
Note: From 19 November 2021 purchases made using Three Pay aren’t included in your Spend Cap. To find out more, click here.

1
Check with the customer about the disputed charges, for example, when the charges were incurred, and the amount being disputed and follow this process.

If the charges were incurred while roaming in Go Roam destinations, follow the below section:

Charges incurred while roaming in Go Roam destinations
1
Follow this process and check if the charges disputed are valid.

2
If the charges disputed are valid raise the below case to Billing Analysis.

Case Type Level 1: Billing Queries/Issues
Case Type Level 2: Investigation Required
Case Type Level 3: Data Usage

3
Tell them:

We'll send you a text within SLA once our specialist Billing Team has looked into this for you.

Note: Go to Fusion to send the customer an SMS using the Sending an SMS or Email through Fusion (Amdocs B2C) process.

Send the following SMS - Bill_Case.

If Billing Analysis has investigated the charges and found them to be valid, then check:

If the charges are valid and the customer is disputing for the first time, follow First time dispute or no OOB credit offered accordion below

They've previously had a credit for Out-of-Bundle (OOB) charges so we wouldn't be able to credit again.
If the customer was offered a credit in the same contract term, they’ll not be eligible for another one. OOB credits are limited to once per contract term, until the customer upgrades the contract and starts a new contract term.

Wrong Add-on is active
1.	Check if the customer has already sent a proof confirming a discount or promotion that was offered to them.
2.	If the customer hasn't sent us the proof of a promotion offered to them, ask them to email it to our Three Customer Services email address, along with their Three phone number or account number as a reference.
3.	Give the SLA to the customer.
4.	Once we receive the proof from the customer, deactivate the Add-on and raise the following case for recalculation:

Case Status: Open.
Level 1: Billing Queries/Issues.
Level 2: Investigation required.
Level 3: Add-on.
Queue group: Billing Analysis.
Tell them: We'll call you or send you a text within SLA once our specialist Billing Team has looked into this for you.

Note: Billing Analysis will investigate the usage/charges on the customers account.
•	If recalculation is needed, BA will apply the credit and send a SMS to let the customer know about it.
•	If the investigation proves 'No error found' and the usage is valid, BA will send a SMS to let the customer know about it.
•	If the account is closed/suspended or the case raised is incorrect/incomplete- BA will reassign the case to the advisor who raised it, under their reporting manager’s queue, with an update. In this scenario, the advisor would need to call the customer back within the promised SLA to give an update. If the advisor is on Leave/WO, their reporting manager needs to make sure that the customer is called back within the promised SLA.

If the customer's issue has occurred less than 3 times and has been going on for less than 28 days offer a line rental credit.
If the customer has experienced multiple issues within the same postcode area (at least 3 issues within the last 3 months) follow CP3 or CP4, depending on whether the fix date is available on Resolve.
Offering a credit
1
Check their account to see if a network credit has been given recently for the same issue. If it has, check what day the line rental credit has been given up to and only calculate for after that date using the Daily Line Rental Calculator .
Note: You can only offer line rental credit from the date when the last credit finished.
2
If they haven't been given credit before, calculate the Daily Line up to the date the fix is shown on Resolve. If the date isn't provided and Resolve indicates the customer will receive an update within the next 7 days, offer a credit for the next 7 days and ask the customer to keep an eye on our website for more info on the fix date.
Note: You can backdate credit up to 7 days prior to the customer reporting (calling to report) the issue as long as Resolve shows it to have been ongoing from that date.

Check Interactions on the account and explain to the customer:

The charges are valid.
They've previously had a credit for Out-of-Bundle (OOB) charges so we wouldn't be able to credit again.
If the customer was offered a credit in the same contract term, they’ll not be eligible for another one. OOB credits are limited to once per contract term, until the customer upgrades the contract and starts a new contract term.
That they can use the Three App to help monitor their usage and control their spend
Note: See statements on how to present this message to the customer here.

If the customer accepts your explanation, send the SMS OOB_INFO

If the customer still disputes the charges, follow the usual complaints process.

Customer has been charged non-DDI fee but seems to be an issue of the customer not being aware that the AT/DF agreements were individual rather than one payment. AT DDI was cancelled it would appear in error. Complaint case has been raised by the customer as she feels she was mis-sold at store level. Way in which the agent handles this initially though is bizarre, asking the customer ""if they are happy"" with the charge. This is far too leading as it's an obvious response which will lead to the credit being applied.

The customer is looking for a refund of less than £20 and the advisor is empowered to do so as there are no previous non-DDI charge refunds. Also first time the customer has expressed mild dissatisfaction about this charge so either article would hold water for applying the credit.

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned? – Wrong credit code was used because it’s not an available option on the way the agent chose to credit the account. Agent could have completed this correctly had they applied it through a charge level instead. As noted above, agent is using leading language.

If the customer's issue has occurred less than 3 times and has been going on for less than 28 days offer a line rental credit.

If the customer has experienced multiple issues within the same postcode area (at least 3 issues within the last 3 months) follow CP3 or CP4, depending on whether the fix date is available on Resolve.

Offering a credit
1
Check their account to see if a network credit has been given recently for the same issue. If it has, check what day the line rental credit has been given up to and only calculate for after that date using the Daily Line Rental Calculator .

Note: You can only offer line rental credit from the date when the last credit finished.

2
If they haven't been given credit before, calculate the Daily Line up to the date the fix is shown on Resolve. If the date isn't provided and Resolve indicates the customer will receive an update within the next 7 days, offer a credit for the next 7 days and ask the customer to keep an eye on our website for more info on the fix date.

Note: You can backdate credit up to 7 days prior to the customer reporting (calling to report) the issue as long as Resolve shows it to have been ongoing from that date.

3
Apply the credit using the one-off charge code B2C - Network Fault

4
Once the credit has been applied,

Tell them:
This credit will apply to your next month's bill and if you're on Direct Debit, it will automatically be included in your next payment.
5
Update interaction notes with credit amount offered.

Customer has called in to make arrangements/payment for their arrears and around roughly 22 minutes in, a discussion around the non-DDI fee begins. Customer *is* borderline doing enough to be considered making claims towards being unhappy about the fee but the main thing she's asking is why the £5 charge exists in the first place. The agent continually answers the question poorly and keeps repeating that it's a process and at a point explains that even he doesn't really know why it exists. Customer cools off and goes to move on but Aliasgar then brings the conversation back to highlight the dissatisfaction and explains he'll offer a credit. Avoidable credit with a better explanation and didn't need to be revisited by the agent.

You can still apply credits under Three's policies for things like:
1.	Out-Of-Bundle charges
2.	Shortcode charges (e.g. for 69 and 89 numbers)
3.	Network issues
4.	When an account has been cancelled in error
5.	Delivery issues
When it comes to resolving any issue, a sincere apology is key. Take a look at some examples if needed. You can offer a Quality Service Add-on to the customer if an extra apology is needed

Note: You can backdate credit up to 7 days prior to the customer reporting (calling to report) the issue as long as Resolve shows it to have been ongoing from that date.

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned? – Wrong credit code was used and put through as poor customer service rather than the usual non-DDI fee credit. Arguably, both are acceptable as the customer tried to do this through her app and it failed but it's likely this was because she was trying to user her sister's details rather than her own.

Support evidence – 

If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.

If you can gauge that offering a goodwill credit will resolve the customers complaint/stop the complaint escalating further, you can offer a credit up to the below limits.
•	The amount of goodwill credit to be offered is dependent on the customers level of impact. You need to assess the level of impact and decide on the amount of credit to be offered.

•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.

Object ID 261220

Support evidence - 

If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
It’s always important that our initial priority is resolving any customer issue. Goodwill should be offered over and above a resolution to acknowledge customer experience.

Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.

Support Evidence - If the customer purchased Data and Call Abroad recurring Add-ons through the Three Mobile App or in their online account via a new sale order, they will not receive a warning message explaining they will incur a full charge on their bill.

Once you confirm that multiple passes were purchased and they are unused, raise an ITSD to deactivate the additional/unused passes.

Confirm the below information (mandatory) with the customer and update it in the ITSD:
Which app version is the customer using?
What steps have they followed on the mobile app to buy the passes?
Did they get a white screen or an error message saying ‘something went wrong’? We need elaborate details on what was the error.
Mention that the details need to be added to INC300001681353.

Refund the amount for the unused passes. Apply the charge reversal using code B2C - Credit for Add-on.

This will make sure that the unused passes are expired, and customer is also refunded the amount so that they don’t call back.

•	The charges are valid.
•	They've previously had a credit for Out-of-Bundle (OOB) charges so we wouldn't be able to credit again.
•	If the customer was offered a credit in the same contract term, they’ll not be eligible for another one. OOB credits are limited to once per contract term, until the customer upgrades the contract and starts a new contract term.
•	That they can use the Three App to help monitor their usage and control their spend",Yes,"[""Credit Adherence accuracy"",""Credit Code accuracy"",""Credit Value accuracy""]",Customer has been charged for Daily roaming charge. The advisor has explained the customer post which has given that as a goodwill credit. This is not OOB. So even if its given in the past we can give that as a gesture of goodwill.

The customer now owes £30 for Sep & Oct bills, but said they didn’t know the account had gone through as they ended the procedure and did I with another provider.

The agent offers credit against the ETF that would be due, and then changes this to offer £30 GW for the current balance due, and a FOC cancellation.

As the sale was self service, with no Three error established, and unable to see trigger words used this doesn’t support the GW credit.

The customer mistakenly processed a SIM-to-SIM upgrade, believing it to be a plan change with a higher LR. The customer was unaware that the upgrade would incur Early Termination Fee charges and stated that no such information was provided at the point of the upgrade.

The customer, who is on a pension and experiencing financial hardship, expressed an inability to pay the charges. Considering the customer's unawareness of the charges and their financial situation, the advisor offered a waiver on the ETF charges.

Since the upgrade was completed online, all relevant information was available on the account. As there was no scope for further investigation, the advisor provided an on-call resolution to ensure customer satisfaction and maintain their business with Three.""",Remains Unjustified,"Appears that a commercial decision was made against policy - the customer upgraded themselves early via self service and incurred an EUF as still within the contract term. (Outside of the 38 days of the minimum term to upgrade without an EUF being applicable). 

Customer was within 14 days when the credit was applied, change of mind period was eligible but agent decided to go with the credit instead against company T&C's. Upgrade reversal would have been the correct resolution.

No grounds to remove the EUF charge, customer in financial hardship as the Tech M notes suggest then why allow the customer to pay more monthly on their plan if they are struggling.

Support evidence – 
If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.

They claim they were informed they would only need to pay £31.11 on the next bill. (Customer was charged £20 for mid-month addon activated and another £20 as per bill cycle)

As these charges are for an add-on purchased by the customer and not an out-of-bundle charge, the """"Managing Billing Disputes (Amdocs B2C)"""" process does not apply in this case.

To address the customer's concern, the advisor offered a one-month waiver for the add-on, citing that the customer was told they would only be charged £31.11 and instead was charged £51.11. 

The waiver was provided under Goodwill Empowerment, considering the medium impact caused by the add-on not being activated or deactivated as promised, which resulted in a higher bill and potential bank charges for the customer.""",Remains Unjustified,"Synopsis?

Support Evidence - 
Customer is not eligible for Right to Exit but wants to cancel
Not all customers contacted about 3G switch off will be given the Right to Exit. This could be because:

They are within their minimum term of a device contract, but are not using the compatible device provided at the point of sale / upgrade

They have used some services within the impacted areas, but do not meet the usage threshold for Right to Exit

Customer is out of their minimum term and can cancel any time

Customer who have upgraded with us on or after 18th Jan 2023 would have accepted terms about 3G switch off

If the customer has not received any contact from us about the 3G switch off, then its unlikely that they have used their services within the impacted area based on the last 3 full calendar months.

Agent from 07/10/2024 offered a FOC cancellation under 3G shut off when it should have been done under CP w/ a resolve check. This wasn't completed.

Clear evidence confirms that the CRT advisor had offered a free-of-charge cancellation to the customer during the prior interaction. However, the previous advisor only reversed the ETF charge on one account, failing to reverse the charge on the other account.

During the current interaction, the customer highlighted their financial vulnerability, explaining that they are unable to afford the remaining ETF charges. Considering previous advisor did not fully address the issue and the customer's financial hardship, the advisor assured the customer that the remaining charges would be waived.""",Remains Unjustified,"Synopsis?
Customer wanted to cancel and use PAC code for two subscriptions due to coverage, 07/06/2024 the PAC was requested and used. ETF's applied which the customer was unhappy about - ETF amounts were shared. 

Customer chose to take PAC and leave by their own accord within contract term. Notes from 14/11/2024 are not clear enough to justify the credit, appears empowerment was offered as a resolution at the time incorrectly. No clear notes if waiver was for one or both subscriptions.

The account is not cancelled because there is no reason to cancel as we havent proven network/tech fault, also, even if there was these issues we would not have cancelled contract unless device was sent back to us.

In this scenario, as there is no fault identified with the service we should not be cancelling contract.

The contract started on 09/02/2024, so this has only been active for 10 months. The customer first contacted us to report network issues on 12/02. A reset was done on the router and this seems to have rectified the issue. This happens again on 21/03. The customer then contacts us on 09/05 to report intermittent disconnection and the agent uses empowerment and CP5 guidance to offer FOC cancellation. The customer says that he will need time to find a new BB provider, we call customer back a week later but we do not reach him, and we do not hear anything else from the customer regarding his HBB account until 21/10. We again offer FOC cancellation, cease the account with immediate effect, and send a Jiffy bag to the customer to return the hub. The customer agreed to this resolution, the agent gives the C8 script and closed the case with resolution. The customer then calls in on 02/12 looking for a resolution to his complaint and wants a refund for the payments made towards his HBB account. We give the customer £50 GW after seeking TL approval. 

Are we aligned or not aligned with the applied credit?  No

Is there a support article that supports the credit being applied?  No

Which part of the article supports the decision? N/A

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned? As per the notes on the account, we use empowerment to offer the customer FOC cancellation in May as per CP5. The customer then does not contact us to proceed with the cancellation until 5 months later, during which bills have been generated and paid by the customer. There is also usage in this time. As we offered the customer a suitable resolution, but he did not take steps to action this, and as there has been usage on the account, we would not be liable to refund any payments made. We made attempts during this time to contact the customer to proceed with the cancellation, but the customer did not speak with us regarding it. The agent explains that the FOC cancellation was a goodwill gesture in itself but could have referred to the fact that the customer did not contact us to cancel until 5 months after this was initially offered. This could have helped with objection handling.

Offering a credit
1
If the customer's issue has been going on for more than 28 days and Wi-Fi Calling isn't an option, use these steps to offer a line rental credit.

Check their account to see if a network credit has been given recently for the same issue. If it has, check what dates this covers.

Note: You can only offer line rental credit from the date when the last credit finished.

2
For Mobile, SIM, and Mobile Broadband offer 50% line rental up until the fix date shown on Resolve, and if the date isn't available, offer 1 month line rental from today's date.

Note: Do not use the calculator if you need to apply a 1-month line rental credit. Directly apply the credit for the MRC on the account.

Make sure the underlying issue is resolved and you have provided apologies/assurances to the customer to resolve the situation.

If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.
It’s always important that our initial priority is resolving any customer issue. Goodwill should be offered over and above a resolution to acknowledge customer experience.

Complaining about mis-selling 01/12/24

Agent on the call has identified the customer believes he was mis-sold in a Three store, and he would like his PP to be lowered to what was agreed. However on the same call, the customer advises he also has network issues and is unable to use the internet. 

Agent has noted mis-selling in his notes, and raised a complaints case for Mis-selling - to be investigated. However, he has applied a credit for £20 under code 'B2C - Network Fault' without running resolve or completing any diagnostic checks. Resolve must be ran within 24 hours to apply a network credit - last time resolve was ran was 17/10/24.

Support evidence - 
If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.
It’s always important that our initial priority is resolving any customer issue. Goodwill should be offered over and above a resolution to acknowledge customer experience.

QA note: A BA case for this scenario was underway from earlier on 02/12/24.  There was no comment to state that investigation was concluded and any credit should be given.

The agent has used the B2C - Credit for Out of Bundle credit code which would not be correct, however this should only be given once the outcome of the BA case is given and if this indicates a refund is applicable.

If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.
It’s always important that our initial priority is resolving any customer issue. Goodwill should be offered over and above a resolution to acknowledge customer experience.

AS PER PROCESS FOR NON GEO CALLS:
Calls to 084, 087, 09 or 118 are service numbers. For more information, visit www.three.co.uk/specialnumbers.
For customers choosing to use 118313 and 118333 directory enquiry numbers these will be charged £3.60 to connect and after the first minute, then they will be charged 10p per minute plus the company's access charge.

Service numbers are split into 2 parts on their bill:
access charge (set by us)
service charge (set by the organisation). Check three.co.uk/terms-conditions/business-price-guides for more information on pricing.

Support Evidence - Customer took HBB on 27/09/24
Had coverage issues within first few days and after multiple resolves ran, had decided to return the router and cancel under 30DMBG for HBB.
Cancellation request - 31/10/24
Case raised to order jiffy bag to be sent to customer - 241031102856033
During this time, the customer also requested a FOC cancellation on his SIMO also due to coverage issues. Coverage policy followed.

14/11/24 - customer notified we have not recieved his device and will be charged if it is not received soon
(customer had not received his jiffy bag and therefore it had to be re-ordered, case re-raised - 241121102925252)

1/12/24 - another notification to customer sent advising there would be charges applied as device not received back in warehouse. 

9/12/24 - ETF waived by CRT

In summary, the returns process was followed correctly in the first instance allowing 30 days for HBB returns policy and also following coverage policy for SIMO free cancellation, and correct cases raised to return device however, the jiffy bag not being received for weeks held everything up and the charges applied were unavoidable as this is an automated process if no device returned. The correct action was taken to waive off the ETF as customer not liable to pay this.

Support Evidence - 

We should be requesting proof instead of applying a GW credit here. Proofs should be added to attachments in complaint. We cannot verify the customer has sent this, or that the payment had been made because there are no proofs in attachments. The customer has also historically had repeated failed arrangements, missed payments etc and therefore crediting this is not the correct action. The customer had also previously mentioned a job loss. We need to take steps to understand if there is a vulnerability and record accordingly.

The customer complains about the prices on a deal they were thinking of taking. However, goes on to further explain that their complaint isn't about the deal specifically, but more about how when questioning this with the agent, he wasn't able to give him an answer he was happy with. The agents wouldn't have to share information on how Three chooses to price their deals. But the customer felt he was going round in circles and remained unhappy with the explanation around this or lack thereof.

If the customer went to Ofcom about this and complained about Three's pricing, Ofcom would not oblige.

Support Evidence - 

If the customer has a 5G Home Broadband hub, they need to return it to us, irrespective of how long they’ve had the account, or the cost of the device will be applied to their account.

Customer did return device, however, there was a stuck order on the account preventing it from being cancelled. This meant the customer continued to be charged. 

The agent took the correct action by offering a credit to cover this, however, this should have been done without negotiation in this scenario. The agent initially told the customer to wait until the final bill was generated. But the agent should have been able to see the situation and the reason for the continued billing. There would have been no need to say this to customer, as this only aggravated the customer who thought there was still a chance Three were going to ask him to pay for this. It would have been better placed to say something like ""I can see the reason you have been charged again is because there has been a system error when trying to cancel your account, but please do not worry we will clear this balance in full when we are able to fix this issue. For now, you may still receive automated emails about the payment due, but again, please ignore these as we will take care of the bill once the account has been fully cancelled."" This would have put the customer at ease. 

The case was closed without resolution at this stage and this could have been avoided had the outcome/resolution been positioned better. 

The credit code used was also incorrect. It was applied as a GWG, where it should have been account not cancelled.

Support Evidence - 
It looks like the customer had tried to cancel all of his accounts and to his knowledge had paid his bills. Unfortunately it seems Three have not cancelled the customers smartwatch paired account (costing £5 per month) 

Contract for smartwatch pairing taken on 20/09/22
Cancellation 06/12/24

Reason: network issues which have progressively gotten worse

Customer called 10/07/2024 initially regarding network issues
PAC issued: 12/08/24 prior to contract end date

Called back 21/09/24 and notified Three that he had cancelled due to network issues and had been offered FOC cancellation, however there was no evidence on the account. Call was transferred to complaints. 

Repeat calls follow on: 27/09/24, 28/09/24, 30/09/24, 06/11/24, 28/12/24, 02/01/25

Offering GW to cover the final bill in this scenario was the correct course of action to avoid any escalation. I am aligned with the decision considering customers repeat contacts, bill amount and a clear view of the journey 

I am also aligned with the code used, because in this scenario, although the account was not cancelled as the customer believes it should have been, there is no physical proof for us to see on the account. Goodwill would be the option to go with here.",No,,,,,,,,,,,13/01/2025,5.81,5.81

Support Evidence - First time dispute - no credit previously offered under the OOB code.
OOB charges between £10.01 - £60	Step1: Negotiate and offer up to 50% of disputed amount
Step 2: If the customer doesn't agree, offer a one-off credit up to £60 of the disputed amount	

It is clear from the customers credit history that we have never applied a credit under the OOB code. So therefore, this can be offered as a full credit to cover the outstanding amount in this instance with no negotiation.

However, the agent has applied the credit under the credit code B2C-Poor customer service GW. This is the incorrect code. By not documenting this correctly under the correct code B2C-Credit for Out Of Bundle, if the customer ever has another issue in future where they require OOB credit, the agent will give further credit because there has been no OOB code used and the process specifically states it can be offered if not offered previously.",Yes,"[""Credit Code accuracy""]","Customer is disputing that he was not able to use the service abroad for 2 weeks and is not willing to pay the bill for the month as he didn’t get service.  Customer was not only disputing the OOB charges but also the monthly LR as he was not able to use the services abroad. The credit that was offered was not for the OOB charges but for the LR for which the customer was not willing to pay.

Support Evidence - Customer had a contract for 4G Plus Home Broadband. As per support ""Customers with a dongle, Mi-Fi or 4G Home device don't need to return the device.""

Despite the customer talking about returning their device in January 2024, this is irrelevant since it is not necessary. 
Agents who have had interactions with the customer have also referred to the fact that there is no notes and no evidence of the customer having been offered a FOC cancellation and so it cant be honoured. However, if we look at complaint case: 240124101835852 - there are notes from 24/01/2024 ""Informed the cx that since the services haven't been working we will help
cx wasn't happy with the services not working for a year a more so offered cancellation ,
cx was further upset offered waiver but the cx denies to pay so offered complete waiver""

I have considered the credit offered by the agent - £111.32 and I am aligned with both the amount and code used.

•	Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.
It’s always important that our initial priority is resolving any customer issue. Goodwill should be offered over and above a resolution to acknowledge customer experience.

The Amdocs notes state they negotiated £50 GW for the issue with paramount plus showing again on the customers bill after the contact at the start of Jan 25 to cancel this. I agree this could be justified as there were trigger words & customer has called us again believing we have not acted on the instruction before for Paramount + cancellation.

A further £60 has been offered with the justification for this to help the customer as they are struggling with their bills.  Customer said they has been billed incorrectly with us taking payment twice. This is not part of the GW process for us to offer financial help. GW should be offered to acknowledge customer service failings. 

Any billing queries should have been investigated/explained further.
The agent should have supported the customer to get a better understanding of the breakdown of their bills, confirm when the believe we took 2 payments, establish if they are using both lines on the account etc. Customer said they have issues with reading and writing, therefore they may not be familiar with the information contained on the bill.

Support Evidence - 
The customer claims they called to cease the contract, but there is no evidence on the account

No - Customer is outside their contract term
If there is usage on the account:
Explain to the customer they will need to give their 30 days notice.
If you’re a CRT advisor, follow Cease a contract (Voice, MBB/HBB Retention - Amdocs B2C) process
If the customer doesn't agree, follow the BAU process.

If you’re a Manage advisor, cease the account by following the How to raise a cease order process
Tell them:
We need 30 days' notice to close the account. I've raised a request for your account to be cancelled with the notice period.

If the customer doesn’t agree, escalate it to your team leader. Do not transfer to CRT.

Although there was usage on the account, and technically does not fall into the above category. Considering the customers situation which was that they had actually cancelled their account however there was a dual SIM and the other SIM was being used, but the customer hadn't understood this because no one told them about it. So when they switched over to Vodafone, they hadn't realised the other SIM was still being used because it was still the same phone. I agree that the agent should be using their empowerment and preventing escalation of the complaint because the customer mentioned going to the OMB.

Support evidence - 
If you can gauge that offering a goodwill credit will resolve the customers complaint/stop the complaint escalating further, you can offer a credit up to the below limits.
•	The amount of goodwill credit to be offered is dependent on the customers level of impact. You need to assess the level of impact and decide on the amount of credit to be offered.
•	The limits below are a maximum amount and you should only offer the maximum when there has been a high impact to the customer or high level of dissatisfaction.

Empowerment used - Yes

I cannot see any justification to offering £100 credit, and believe no credit was due as there has been no Three failing evidenced. 

The customer has not been given a ‘GW’ amount, they have told us what they want and we have given in to this, offering a credit of £100 against the £110 they have paid in the add on.  

The BA outcome was that the add on had been self-serve via the app, therefore no Three error.  The customer has been receiving this charge on their bills since Feb 2024, therefore it is reasonable to suggest they should have brought this to our attention before paying this for 11 months.

I cannot see any justification on the complaint to support why a credit of £100 was offered, other than the customer being unhappy.

(The agent has applied £50 credit, the other £50 has yet to be applied)",Yes,"[""Credit Adherence accuracy"",""Credit Code accuracy"",""Credit Value accuracy""]","""Outcalled as promised call back to share update on BA case revert, customer was disputing Monthly Boost add on charges of 10GBP/month. Advisor has informed that they are liable to pay as it was activated via self-service. Customer denied and was not happy, agent first offer 20GBP and then 50GBP. As the charges are for 12 months customer proactively asked for 100GBP and mentioned will not accept anything lower than that. Agents checked with their manager and still attempted to negotiate but as customer was unhappy and persistent offered 100GBP which they finally accepted.
Considering how adamant the customer was about getting the credit of 100GBP, and agent has explained and negotiated as well the credit offer is justified under the GWG Empowerment policy""",Remains Unjustified,"Synopsis:
The customer has been paying for a £10 monthly add on since Feb 2024 which they state they have no knowledge of.

Customer wanting to raise a complaint as they're looking to upgrade but aren't able to because the account details have not been updated. Customer claims to have repeat contact into the given email address with the added proofs. The customer follows up with a pro-rata question in which the advisor answers then offers GW to waive the total bill.

Aligned with the credit - value is within advisor limit, £20 max would have been more acceptable here for inconvenience but the given value resolves the credit and limit is okay. (Inconvenience + repeat contact), giving a full waiver implies that the bill is invalid, which is not the case.

•There has been no justification why the customer was offered GW for Threepay charges other than them being unhappy and they would struggle to pay the bill.  The Goodwill given is the highest available to the agent, yet they have not detailed in the notes any error by Three in this complaint that would fall under the following from the GW support article:

Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.

If the customer is due any credit, this should come under the credit code ‘B2C-Credit For Payforit’, but this should be after following all the steps under the article Managing Three Pay or Shortcode dispute (Amdocs B2C).  If applicable, as per the article, a Payforit escalation case should have been raised to escalate this further, explaining the customer is liable for the charges as these have been incurred via Threepay by his daughter completing the required steps, and not charged by Three directly.

If there were any concerns regarding payment, the Payment Support Team could be consulted.

•	When dealing with the complaint, make sure to offer an apology and relevant assurance to give the customer the confidence that this won’t happen again.
o	If the customer accepts the above, do not offer a goodwill credit.

There was no error made by Three. The customer accepted the information/explanation given by the agent for the price change and also that they were not eligible for an upgrade. 
There is no evidence of the customer showing dissatisfaction after the explanation has been given by the agent.

The offer of GW does not have any justification within the Amdocs notes. Agent states customer was 'not happy', but this is not supported by the chat conversation.

Objection Handling - ""The charge is too much, I can't afford to pay it""

The cancellation charge is calculated based on the remaining months of your contract. As you’ve cancelled X months early, the cost is chargeable.

If you need more time to pay, we can discuss what options are available to support you.

Follow the process relevant to your skillset:

Customer Collection process (Amdocs B2C – Welcome, Manage and Billing Teams)

The customer claims to have been told in store that due to the annual price increase the customer has the right to leave the network. The conversation started about this, the customer also mentioned signal issues. The cancellation is worded round by the CRT agent that it can't be done for the API but for the coverage issues, TS takes place and options are checked. CP followed, Cust refused credit, FOC cancellation offered 11/03/2025, same agent applies credit on 07/04/2025.

Customer has previously disputed a charge

Check Interactions on the account and explain to the customer:
•	The charges are valid.
•	They've previously had a credit for Out-of-Bundle (OOB) charges so we wouldn't be able to credit again.
•	If the customer was offered a credit in the same contract term, they’ll not be eligible for another one. OOB credits are limited to once per contract term, until the customer upgrades the contract and starts a new contract term.
•	That they can use the Three App to help monitor their usage and control their spend
Note: See statements on how to present this message to the customer here.

- The customer contacted because they were having broadband issues. The advisor ran Resolve and advised:  We’re sorry but there is an issue in the area which is going on a bit longer than we hoped.

Only if you identify that:
The customer was given incorrect information
The customer was given incomplete information
A promised call back not made
A promised action not taken in case of the above processes
If the customer isn’t happy due to any other scenario and you’re able to gauge that by offering a GWG credit up to £20 will avoid the call/chat being transferred to the Complaints team, follow the below process.

No complaint language used by the customer, customer made a mistake and advised later in the chat she does not need the full 10GB data. Agent could have discussed with the customer how much data she needs until her data refreshed, discuss the prices and potentially then could have had a conversation around the price and providing credit if then the customer was not happy.

Customer claims to have been offered a FOC upgrade, there are NO notes to support this the agent applies a credit under 'Empowerment' with the following note:

""Customer is been charged for EUF when he was offered FOC upgrade .. dont see any notes , but went by customers words .. offered a credit for EUF as per cmt empowerment""

Taking the customers word should not be the justification for any credit. (We need evidence).

However, after a quick investigation on the account from UKQA side the customer was SIMO moving to a DF HS after 90 days (Eligibility met). The process states that this is possible if a credit check is passed.

There are no notes on Amdocs showing any contact from the customer until now to query these being PAYM, or to question any of the collections actions on the account.

Given this was in store, and the length of time now passed, there is nothing in Support to follow for this scenario, as we would not establish any misselling after this length of time (CRT agent mentions they wont be able to follow misselling during the transfer from the Fraud triage agent. They then state since these have already been ceased, they will just need to waive ETFs, but there is no justification for this on the complaint notes.)

The CRT agent does not have any discussion with the customer, they immediately offer to waive the ETF without any probing of the situation with the customer.

(2) If the customer doesn’t accept your apology as a resolution, and their issue doesn’t relate to any of the above, you can offer a goodwill credit to avoid the call/chat being further escalated.
You should use the Goodwill Matrix, and refer to the below examples, to determine the customer’s level of impact and offer the goodwill amount based on the level of impact and your role limit.

Goodwill Matrix

Medium Impact: Repeat contact to the CC leading to customer dis-satisfaction but no major financial impact or harm.
Examples could be - 
o	Add-on not activated or deactivated as promised leading to higher bill and/or bank charges



If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned? 

Agent applied credit of £20.00 in accordance with “exceptions” impact criteria on the Goodwill matrix. This scenario falls under the “medium impact” criteria and warrants a £10.00 credit.

(2) If the customer doesn’t accept your apology as a resolution, and their issue doesn’t relate to any of the above, you can offer a goodwill credit to avoid the call/chat being further escalated.

You should use the Goodwill Matrix, and refer to the below examples, to determine the customer’s level of impact and offer the goodwill amount based on the level of impact and your role limit.

Goodwill Matrix
Exceptions: Ongoing complaints and repeat interactions with trigger words used leading to customer distress and dissatisfaction.
Scenarios can be from Medium or High impact however severity would be higher because this is an ongoing complaint and repeat interactions.


If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?
Customer has repeatedly used trigger words and explained significant inconvenience as a result of delayed port in. Customer has visited the Three store twice and ends the chat stating they will be leaving Three as a result of this. (Medium impact exacerbated by repeat trigger words and distress to customer, leading to exception criteria being applicable)

The agent confirmed via notes the ETF waiver had been offered, and applied the credit on the account, however the agent has applied a £128.76 charge level credit, which applies an overall credit of £154.51 on the account.  
The agent should have applied approx. £106.78 charge level credit on the account.

The overall amount appears to be formed of the ETF waiver plus a GW amount, however these credits should be split if being applied.

From the chat we can see the customer was looking for additional credit for the inconvenience of 50% ETF waiver not applied on the account yet & for them having to contact us again – customer used trigger words.  
The agent then indicates they will offer an additional credit amount of £5 which isn't accepted, then £10, and then advises the customer they will credit £154.51 to the account to leave a £100 final bill.  

If the agent wanted to give the customer any additional credit in the form of GW, this should have been applied as a separate credit, and the ETF amount on the account should have been in line with what was originally offered - 50% waiver

Support evidence:
If you’ve followed the relevant process for why the customer is complaining, but the customer remains unhappy, you can offer a goodwill credit in the below scenarios:
•	Trigger words: When a customer is using trigger words that indicates that there may be further escalation i.e Ombudsman, ELT, Social Media, Legal, Court, Citizens Advice, Trading Standards and Press.
•	Repeat Calls: If a customer is repeatedly calling the Contact Centre with their issue remaining unresolved and this is detrimentally impacting experience.
•	Protect future customer experience: To acknowledge a poor customer experience that a customer has had with us that may impact their image of our brand and impact our reputation.
•	Customer service failings: When we have clearly let a customer down by not following the correct process or not applying the correct actions when expected.

If you can gauge that offering a goodwill credit will resolve the customers complaint/stop the complaint escalating further, you can offer a credit up to the below limits.
•	The amount of goodwill credit to be offered is dependent on the customers level of impact. You need to assess the level of impact and decide on the amount of credit to be offered.
•	The limits below are a maximum amount and you should only offer the maximum when there has been a high impact to the customer or high level of dissatisfaction.

Are we aligned or not aligned with the applied credit?
Agent was aligned as per support - in addition to this, I've considered the credit fair as the previous agent could have applied a spend cap and hasn't, thus this has generated another charge to the customer and been poor service, justifying the credit.

Drop Down: Outage lasts 28 days or more 3+ issues within 3 months (same postcode) & with no fix date (Excl. congestion): CP4

(2) If the customer's issue has been going on for 28 days or more or if they've been impacted by 3 or more issues within the last 3 months and Wi-Fi Calling isn't an option, use these steps to offer a line rental credit.

Drop Down – Offering credit 

(2) For Mobile, SIM, and Mobile Broadband offer 50% line rental up until the fix date shown on Resolve. Using the Daily Line Rental Calculator, select 50% LR to get the exact figure.

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?
Agent did not offer or signpost Wi-Fi calling as per CP4 process despite device compatibility and native dialler usage. Further, agent has applied a full month line rental credit when the process states 50% Line rental credit applicable for mobile/sim products. As per Line rental calculator 50% equates to £9.21 which should have been applied (under CPI 2025). Support guidance does not state retrospective credit can be applied (which the agent has done), more than one month credit can only be applied if specified resolution date shown on Resolve.

Which part of the article supports the decision? 

You should use the Goodwill Matrix, and refer to the below examples, to determine the customer’s level of impact and offer the goodwill amount based on the level of impact and your role limit.

Goodwill Matrix

Low Impact: No financial impact or harm to the customer – these would be first time contact customers who are unhappy about an issue.

Examples could be –
Incorrect information and/or facing issues to access self-care services


If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?
Credit amount was unaligned with impact level. The customer was simply unaware of policy and frustrated that the pass was not working as expected. A £5.00 GWG would have been appropriate in line with low impact level on Goodwill matrix to alleviate customer frustration and prevent escalation.

(4) Follow the relevant process below

Drop down - Customer says higher bill is due to an error made by Three staff member.

(1)	Investigate and look for evidence that we’ve made an error (e.g. Amdocs Interactions, call listening or chat transcripts).

(2)	If you find evidence to show that we’ve made an error, you can offer the customer a credit for the amount they were overcharged by raising the following case to Billing Analysis.

Case Type Level 1: Billing Queries/Issues.
Case Type Level 2: CC Billing Error Correction.
Case Type Level 3: CC Billing Error Correction
Note: Billing Analysis will investigate the usage/charges on the customer’s account.

(3)	Resolve the customer’s initial query where applicable.
For example:
Deactivate Add-on

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?
Agent has not followed the correct process. The credit code of B2C – Poor Customer service valued at £20.00 has been used to offset the cost of the Unlimited Monthly data Add-on. The agent should have raised a case to billing analysis for the charges to be adjusted accordingly. The customer simply requested the account be reverted to the original monthly cost. Once the initial corrective action had been taken, the agent could have offered a gesture of goodwill if the customer remained dissatisfied.

SIM to Device Finance Handset Upgrades – No Early Upgrade Fee (Amdocs B2C)
Last updated 03/07/2025
Object ID 253333

Which part of the article supports the decision?

SIM Only 12 and 24 month customers can apply for a Device Finance contract after 90 days of their contract completion. An interaction note isn't needed for these customers.
Early Upgrade Fee waiver is only applicable for SIM to DF Handset movement and not SIM to SIM.
A credit check will be applicable for customers moving 12 or 24 months SIM plan to a Device Finance handset contract. If the customer applied for a DF handset and failed the check but passed for a SIM Only plan, they'll need to pass 90 days of their contract before upgrading to a Device Finance handset contract and undergo another credit check.

If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?

Too much credit has been offered. Previous advisor failings and misinformation would warrant a £10.00 goodwill credit as per medium impact level. This advisor has applied a £40.00 credit without appropriate justification to balance off the paramount plus subscription charges. The customer should have been educated on trial period terms and conditions (i.e. subscription period runs from date of purchase, not date of activation)

Last updated 03/07/2025

Which part of the article supports the decision?
Early Upgrade Fee waiver eligibility
You can offer a SIM to DF Handset EUF waiver on STL deals. However, in case a customer has been targeted by a Proactive Campaign, STL deals will not be eligible for EUF waiver.
SIM Only 12 and 24 month customers can apply for a Device Finance contract after 90 days of their contract completion. An interaction note isn't needed for these customers.
Early Upgrade Fee waiver is only applicable for SIM to DF Handset movement and not SIM to SIM.
A credit check will be applicable for customers moving 12 or 24 months SIM plan to a Device Finance handset contract. If the customer applied for a DF handset and failed the check but passed for a SIM Only plan, they'll need to pass 90 days of their contract before upgrading to a Device Finance handset contract and undergo another credit check.

Drop down – Offering a credit 

(2) If they haven't been given credit before, calculate the daily line rental up to the date the fix is shown on Resolve. If the date isn't provided and Resolve indicates the customer will receive an update within the next 7 days, offer a credit for the next 7 days and ask the customer to keep an eye on our website for more info on the fix date.

Note: You can backdate credit up to 7 days prior to the customer reporting (calling to report) the issue as long as Resolve shows it to have been ongoing from that date.


If unaligned, what aspect was unaligned?
Advisor has offered too little credit. Monthly Line Rental value on the account is £98.26 (including VAT). Based on this, the 14-day credit should total to 45.20 at account level in accordance with daily line rental calculator. However, the advisor has only applied 35.99 resulting in an under-credit of £9.21.
